# LAB 2.0

## Hardware Limitations

Arduino:

- V = 5V
- I = up to 40mA

LED

- average forward V = 2.2V
- optimal I = 20mA

Resistors

- they all have the same resistance (220Ω), consequently:
  - in serial, R = n * 220
  - in parallel, R = 220 / n

## Serial Circuit

1 LED: 5V - 2.2V = 2.8V → we still have voltage.

2 LEDs: 2.8V - 2.2V = 0.6V → we still have voltage, the current will be lower, the lights dimmer.

3 LEDs: 0.6V - 2.2V = -1.6V → no more voltage.

→ ANSWER: 2 LEDs before we run out of voltage.

## Parallel Circuit

Each line has a 2.8V voltage, no matter how many → V doesn't vary. 

Each resistor is 220Ω → R doesn't vary.

Consequently, I also doesn't vary.

For each LED/resistor line: I = 2.8V/220Ω = 12.73mA. 

In theory, you could hook up infinite lines if you could provide the current, however Arduino has a current limit of 40mA.

40mA / 12.73mA = 3.14 LEDs.

→ ANSWER: 3 LED before the current starts to decrease and the lights dim out.
