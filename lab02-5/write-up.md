## Remote Temperature Deviation Monitor

### Usefulness

Helps monitor temperature deviations in remote objects that require a specific temperature range or generate their own heat as a biological process.

The user can enter a reference temperature and a tolerance margin in the serial monitor, and the device will blink a red light if the variation of temperature exceeds the tolerance margin. The blinking light is easily perceptible from a distance.

The device can easily be re-initialized and relocated to monitor another object.

It is enclosed within an insulated dome that is open at the bottom, letting the heat fill the dome. Only the LED sticks out from the top of the dome.

### Example Use Cases

- Beehives
- Compost heaps or bins
- Fermentation containers
- Outdoor animal sheds

### Interactions

- Initialize reference and tolerance values
- Change location
